  			<h2> Radio Era </h2>
  			<h4> -2008 </h4>
  			<div class="b_image1" id="b_image1"></div>
  			<p id="b_cap1">My introduction to music was done over the radio.<br>In either the car, or when helping my dad at work.<br>This image of a car stereo is the same stereo in the car we had growing up.<br>And also where my foundation of music was created.</p>
  			<div class="b_image2" id="b_image2"></div>
  			<p id="b_cap2">FAVORITE SONG:<br>"Please Man"<br>by Big and Rich<br><br>I still remember where I was when i first heard this song, on the way into Bellingham to get Italian Sodas with my Mom. And when Please Man came on, it was love at first listen. TBH, this song doesn't have the same effect as it used to, but it's still a fond memory.<br>RATING: 5/10</p>		  		
  			<div class="b_image3" id="b_image3"></div>
  			<p id="b_cap3">This is an average "work" radio<br>I would have to help my dad a lot as a kid, mostly picking up garbage, at his work. One thing that always has stuck in my head is the music we would listen to on the job, and those songs are now cemented as a part of my childhood.</p>

  			<h2> Ipod Era </h2>
  			<h4> 2008 - 2013 </h4>
  			<div class="c_image1" id="c_image1"></div>
  			<p id="c_cap1">FAVORITE SONG:<br>"My Humps"<br>by Black Eyed Peas<br><br>I first found this song while scrolling through my Mom's old ipod. As a kid in elementary school, I thought it was hilarious obviously. I then showed all my friends on the bus the next day. Great song, holds up today.<br>RATING: 8/10</p>
  			<div class="c_image2" id="c_image2"></div>
  			<p id="c_cap2">This is a 6th Gen Ipod<br>It was my first mp3 player, and was a hand-me-down from my mom. I never really bought or added songs to it, because I didn't have money to get new ones. So I listened to the music my mom had downloaded onto it. It was a lot of 90's rap, some pop, and 80's Rock. I became very familiar with SnoopDogg, who was my mom's favorite artist.</p>  		
  			<div class="c_image3" id="c_image3"></div>
  			<p id="c_cap3">Most of the music listening done in this era was done on the school bus with friends. We would often show eachother songs that we each had discovered. As you might have read already by my favorite song in this era, it was a great day when I got to show my friends "My Humps".</p>

  			<h2> Streaming Era </h2>
  			<h4> 2013 - 2016 </h4>
  			<div class="d_image1" id="d_image1"></div>
  			<p id="d_cap1">This is a Kindle Fire HDX<br>Probably my dumbest purchase ever, it was a whopping 350$, which was a lot for my middleschool self. Not to mention I passed on getting an xbox and got this instead. Anyway, the pro to this tablet was being able to stream music for the first time. And with Amazon Prime Music, I was exposed to the world of music I had no idea existed.</p>
  			<div class="d_image2" id="d_image2"></div>
  			<p id="d_cap2">FAVORITE SONG:<br>"Turn Down For What"<br>by DJ Snake<br><br>This BANGER was free with Amazon Prime Music. Most of the prime music songs or albums were usually ones that were not popular or just bad. But not this one. This song, contrary to the name, makes me turn up, to this day.<br>RATING: 7/10</p></p>  		
  			<div class="d_image3" id="d_image3"></div>
  			<p id="d_cap3">You might wonder what Minecraft has to do with my music journey. Well, while i was listening to new music, I was ALWAYS playing Minecraft at the same time. So many of these songs I found at this time go hand in hand with the same Minecraft memories</p>

  			<h2> Multi-Genre Era </h2>
  			<h4> 2016 - 2020 </h4>
  			<div class="e_image1" id="e_image1"></div>
  			<p id="e_cap1">FAVORITE SONG:<br>"All Apologies"<br>by Nirvana<br><br>In my genre-broadening era, Nirvana was one of the bands that I was immediatley drawn to. They quickly became one of my favorite bands. And arguably are my favorite today. All Apologies I still hold to be a top-3 song in their discography. <br>RATING: 10/10</p></p>  
  			<div class="e_image2" id="e_image2"></div>
  			<p id="e_cap2">AT this time, I also got my license!!!<br>Many of my memories in this era are those where I was driving home from practice, or hanging with friends. There was screaming along to lyrics, and crying to some heartfelt ones too. I probably have the most music memories and am the most thankful for this era. There were so many good artists and songs discovered. </p>  		
  			<div class="e_image3" id="e_image3"></div>
  			<p id="e_cap3">It took a long while, but eventually I convinced my mom to get a family Spotify Premium Plan. It was amazing, I could listen to any song, whenever I wanted. I wasn't imprisoned to listen to some free Pitbull album any longer! With all this power I started to search for new music I had never heard before. The genre I fell in love with the most was 90's grunge. However, I listened to a lot of rap, 70's rock, and even some disco.</p>

  			<h2> The Present </h2>
  			<h4> 2020+ </h4>
  			<div class="f_image1" id="f_image1"></div>
  			<p id="f_cap1">Vinyl collecting adds a whole new layer to my music listening experience. It's physical, it's tedious but exclusive, it's art. I've been obsessed with collecting my favorite Artists records ever since I started. As much as people say it sounds better on vinyl, it can sound just as good if done right, but I am not sure about better. Either way, its a fun (and expensive) hobby I've recently gotten into.    </p>
  			<div class="f_image2" id="f_image2"></div>
  			<p id="f_cap2">FAVORITE SONG:<br>"Prayer"<br>by Kendrick Lamar<br><br>Very very recently, I have been on a kick of listening to unreleased music. And I came across this Kendrick song. When I first heard it I couldn't believe he hadn't dropped it, it was so amazing, so soulful, so poetic. It is a perfect song. <br>RATING: 10/10</p></p>  </p>  		
  			<div class="f_image3" id="f_image3"></div>
  			<p id="f_cap3">An experience I will never forget was going to my first concert. It was Kendrick Lamar and Baby Keem, two of my favorite artsits, in Vancouver BC. It was just so crazy to see them perform in front of me, I honestly couldn't believe it was real. And I know it was the only concert I have ever been to, but I really don't think I could have picked a better one. </p>
